That's a very common piece of advice and a tricky situation! Here's a breakdown based on resume best practices and the search results:

The General Rule: Don't Lie

Accuracy is Key: Most career experts and resources advise against outright changing your official job title to something it wasn't. Your resume should be truthful. Background checks often verify titles and dates of employment, and discrepancies can be red flags.
When Clarification is Okay (and Recommended):

Obscure or Internal Titles: If your official title was company-specific jargon (e.g., "Coding Ninja," "Member Technical Staff III," "Impact Manager") or doesn't clearly convey your actual responsibilities to someone outside the company, it's generally acceptable to use a more standard, industry-recognized title that accurately reflects your duties. The goal is clarity, not deception.
Inaccurate Reflection: If your role significantly evolved but your title didn't change (e.g., you were an "Assistant" but were performing manager-level duties), you have options, but directly changing the title is risky.
ATS Optimization: Tailoring keywords is crucial for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Some minor, justifiable title adjustments (like standardizing an internal title) might help with this, but significant changes solely for ATS are discouraged.
How to Handle Similar Experience with Different Titles (Like Yours):

Your past titles like "Project Manager," "Assistant Project Manager," and "Senior System Engineer" are standard and well-understood. Changing "Project Manager" to "Developer Lead" for that past role wouldn't be accurate, even if you led development tasks within that project management role.

Instead of changing past titles, here are better ways to show alignment with the "Developer Lead" role:

Use a Headline/Resume Title: Place a clear title under your name at the top, like: Tommy LI Developer Lead | Senior Software Engineer This immediately tells the recruiter and ATS the role you're targeting.
Leverage Your Summary: Explicitly state your career goal. Your current summary already does this well by highlighting leadership of development teams and seeking a lead role. You could slightly adjust it to say something like: "Seeking a Developer Lead position where I can leverage..."
Focus on Bullet Points: This is the most important part. Under your actual titles ("Project Manager," etc.), ensure your bullet points strongly emphasize the responsibilities and achievements that directly match the Developer Lead JD. Highlight:
Leading development teams/efforts.
Technical decision-making and architecture input.
Mentoring engineers.
Driving the SDLC specifically for software features.
Code reviews, setting technical standards (if applicable).
Hands-on development tasks you performed even as a PM/APM.
Consider Both Titles (If applicable but less common): Some sources suggest listing both the official title and a functional one if there's a significant mismatch, but this can sometimes look confusing.
In summary: Don't change your official past titles like "Project Manager." Instead, use your resume's headline, summary, and especially the bullet points under your actual titles to clearly demonstrate how your experience and leadership align with the "Developer Lead" requirements. This approach maintains honesty while effectively tailoring your application.


Addressing Language and Location on Your Resume
Language Section:
If a job posting does not specify language requirements, you are not obligated to include a language section on your resume. Including it is optional and typically only necessary if language proficiency is relevant to the role or if you believe it strengthens your application. For most technical or developer roles like the BMO Developer Lead, unless the job description explicitly mentions a language requirement (such as French or bilingualism), it is safe to omit or keep this section brief.

Location of Previous Experience:
Regarding the location of your past job experience, there is flexibility:

If the job description does not require local experience, you can choose whether to display the location of each job.

Some candidates omit locations for international roles if they believe it could bias recruiters or ATS systems, especially if the job is in a different country than the one they're applying in.

However, including city and country for each role is standard practice and adds transparency to your work history. If you have recently relocated (e.g., now in Calgary and applying for a Calgary-based job), it's helpful to highlight your current local address at the top of your resume.

Recruiter and ATS Insights:

Many recruiters and HR professionals state that ATS systems in professional, salaried roles are not typically set to auto-reject candidates based on address or location. These filters are more common in high-volume, low-skill roles.

For higher-level positions, as long as you meet the qualifications, your resume will likely be reviewed by a human, regardless of where your previous experience was located.

Summary Table

Section	Required if Not in JD?	Best Practice
Languages	No	Omit unless relevant or strengthens your case
Job Location	No	Optional; include for transparency, but can omit for non-local roles if concerned about bias
Conclusion:
You do not need to include languages or prior job locations on your resume if they are not required by the job description. Focus on tailoring your resume to the skills and experience relevant to the role. For local jobs, listing your current local address is helpful, but omitting locations from older or overseas roles is acceptable and sometimes strategic


【Interview prep isn’t about memorizing answers—it’s about crafting a “persona” that makes them want to choose you ❷】

How do I figure out what kind of person they’re looking for from a job description (JD)?

A JD hides a lot of clues. Beyond technical skills, pay special attention to these:

Repeated adjectives (e.g., independent, proactive, structured)
Emphasized work scenarios (e.g., cross-functional team, fast-paced environment)
The tone used (is it strategy-oriented or execution-focused?)
These words reveal that they’re not just looking for someone who “can do the job,” but someone who “does it in a certain way.”

I’ve compiled 5 of the most common personality traits that appear in JDs to help you identify and prepare more quickly and effectively:



1. If the JD emphasizes “able to manage multiple stakeholders and communicate across teams”

→ I know this role wants a collaborative/communicative persona.

I’d choose to talk about my experience aligning different departments’ needs and cultural differences in a multinational project:

“In a sustainability data analysis project, I was responsible for coordinating between the internal IT department and an external consulting firm. Due to differing terminology and delivery rhythms, I proactively created a data conversion flowchart to help both sides align quickly, enabling us to deliver results on schedule.”


2. If the JD emphasizes “data-driven mindset” or “strong analytical skills”

→ I know they’re looking for a logical, data-fluent persona.

I’d share a story about how I used data to support decision-making:

“In a business strategy course, I was tasked with analyzing revenue structures across different markets. I scraped 150 data points and used Excel for sensitivity analysis, helping the team decide to focus on the German market. Our report earned the highest grade in the class.”


3. If the JD emphasizes “self-starter,” “takes initiative,” or “proactive”

→ I’d choose a story showcasing how I identified a problem and designed a solution:

“In a club event, I noticed the registration process was chaotic, often leading to errors. I independently designed a Google Form with an automated response system, improving accuracy and reducing manual work for organizers. This process was adopted for two subsequent events.”


4. If the JD emphasizes “structured,” “organized,” or “detail-oriented”

→ I know they want someone who values process and clear thinking.

I’d talk about how I built systems to optimize team efficiency:

“In a student consulting project, I handled document and task tracking. When inconsistent file naming caused confusion and version conflicts, I created standardized naming rules and a shared storage structure, along with a project timeline dashboard. This made progress more transparent and saved time searching for files.”


5. If the JD emphasizes “fast-paced environment,” “prioritization skills,” or “multitasking”

→ I know they’re looking for someone who thrives under pressure and adapts quickly.

I’d share a story about delivering reliably in a high-pressure, multitasking scenario:

“During midterms, I was juggling three group projects at critical stages. I proactively mapped out each group’s priority deliverables and team capacity, created an Excel progress tracker, and coordinated timelines with teammates. All three projects were completed on time, and my contributions were recognized by the professor.”

Keyword Inclusion Strategy
According to the ATS research, it's important to use keywords "exactly as they appear in the job description". The BMO job posting uses specific terminology to categorize skills by proficiency level. To optimize your resume:

Use exact terminology: Replace "TDD Principles" with "Test Driven Development" and ensure other keywords match exactly.

Include both forms of acronyms: For example, list "System Development Lifecycle (SDLC)" rather than just "SDLC" to catch both search terms.

Add missing technical keywords: Incorporate "Cloud computing" and "Microservices" where relevant in your experience.

Incorporate soft skills explicitly: Add a "Professional Skills" section that specifically lists: Creative thinking, Building and managing relationships, Emotional agility, Adaptability, Learning Agility, and Data driven decision making.
